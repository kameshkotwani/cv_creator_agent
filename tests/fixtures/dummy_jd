Job Title - Applied AI/ML Engineer
Location - London
Working Pattern - Hybrid (3 days a week in London)




I’m supporting a cutting-edge SportsTech company that’s building AI products for the Sports industry. They use computer vision, biomechanics and performance analytics to analyse human performance. 



This is a great opportunity to join a growing engineering team with someone who wants to build production-grade AI.


This role suits an AI/ML Engineer who enjoys working close to the product, solving tricky problems around human movement, pose estimation and large-scale video data. You’ll join a small senior team, so you’ll have the chance to design core systems, push models into production and see your work used in real-world environments. 



What you’ll be working on



Designing and implementing ML workflows for pose estimation and motion analysis
Evaluating computer vision and ML models on large-scale video datasets
Supporting synthetic data generation and labelling pipelines
Optimising inference for real-time and batch processing
Working closely with engineering, biomechanics and product teams


What they’re looking for



Strong experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow)
Background in 3D human pose estimation, skeletal tracking or multi-view geometry
Solid Python skills and experience with image/video data processing
Understanding of ML model training and evaluation at scale
Comfortable working independently and contributing to collaborative codebases (Git)


Nice to have



Experience in sports science, biomechanics or athlete performance analytics
Familiarity with production engineering practices
Exposure to cloud deployment or MLOps tooling
Experience optimising models for edge devices (TFLite, OpenVINO, ONNX)


If you’re interested in applying your AI/ML skills to real performance data and want to be part of a team shipping usable, production-ready models, I’d love to chat.
